# Kaggle-Online Product Sales

The objective of the competition is to help us build as good a model as possible to predict monthly online sales of a product. Imagine the products are online  self-help programs following an initial advertising campaign.

We have shared the data in the comma separated values (CSV) format.  Each row in this data set represents a different consumer product.

The first 12 columns (Outcome_M1 through Outcome_M12) contains the monthly online sales for the first 12 months after the product launches.  

Date_1 is the day number the major advertising campaign began and the product launched.  

Date_2 is the day number the product was announced and a pre-release advertising campaign began.

Other columns in the data set are features of the product and the advertising campaign.  Quan_x are quantitative variables and Cat_x are categorical variables. Binary categorical variables are measured as (1) if the product had the feature and (0) if it did not.
